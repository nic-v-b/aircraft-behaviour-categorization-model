# aircraft-behaviour-categorization-model

The following repository contains the code used in the article "An Aircraft Categorization Approach using Machine Learning to Analyze Aircraft Behaviour" published in the Journal of Air Transportation.

The dataset used in this code can be found here: [add Zenodo link here]

**How to use:**
1. Use "trajectory_processing.py" to process the dataset into trajectories.
2. Use "cluster_algorithm.py" to train a model that identifies aircraft behaviour categories using a trajectory dataset.
3. Use "plot_visuals.py" to generate visuals used to interpret the results of "cluster_agorithm.py"
